# Financial-risk-detection
Using the best model to predict the defaulters

This project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
and machine learning to conduct risk analysis for loan default
prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By
analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns
and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their
loan payments. This analysis will assist the company in minimizing
financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not
unfairly rejected.
